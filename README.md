[Create your first Outlook addin](https://docs.aurinko.io/article/36-create-your-first-outlook-addin)

The addin manifest file that Aurinko generates for you is just a quickstart sample that you can install in Outlook right away.
The manifest activates the addin's READ mode using outlook/read.html page.
